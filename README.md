Apache-Status-PHP-Parser-Thingy
========================

Parse the output of apachectl fullstatus to give some good insight into what's going on.


Simply run this script either through command line or though a web browser (add some '<code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>' tags for the browser) and you should have a good set of info to look through.

Use this if you're having problem with apache and you have way too many requests to look through to make an educated guess as to what is happening.
